# About

growBook lets users create a personal portfolio of all their plants. It's built with Vue JS, Nuxt, Supabase, Prisma and Tailwind CSS.

Supabase is a Backend-as-a-Service app development platform that provides hosted services including a Postgres database, user authentication and file storage.

growBook makes use of Supabase's Postgres database, we also uses its authentication capabilities to enable login via Google OAuth as well as signup via email and password. Plant-image storage is also provided via Supabase's integration with AWS. The growBook app connects to Supabase's Postgres database via Prisma ORM.

The site is hosted on Vercel and makes use of Vercel's Edge Network to cache and speedily serve content to users.
